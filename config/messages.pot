"The Perspectives of System Informatics (PSI) conference series is a forum"
" for academic and industrial researchers, developers and users working on"
" topics relating to computer, software and information sciences. The "
"conference serves to bridge the gaps between different communities whose "
"research areas are covered by but not limited to foundations of program "
"and system development and analysis, programming methodology and software"
" engineering, and information technologies. The PSI forum provides a "
"venue for such communities at which common problems, methods and "
"methodologies can be discussed and explored. In doing so, PSI aims to "
"support researchers in their quest to improve the reliability, "
"flexibility and efficiency of methods, algorithms and tools for "
"developing computer, software and information systems."
